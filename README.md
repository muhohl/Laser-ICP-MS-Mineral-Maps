# Laser-ICP-MS-Mineral-Maps
Shiny app for plotting Laser ICPMS and EMPA maps. More generally the app can plot heat maps and spatial data that has consistent spacing between x and y coordinates. The underlying plot function uses the ggplot2::geom_spatial() geom. 

Color palletes are derived from the viridis family, developed to offer a more inclusive (color blindness) and realistic color scheme.

This shiny app uses functions from the `geochem` package https://github.com/muhohl/geochem
